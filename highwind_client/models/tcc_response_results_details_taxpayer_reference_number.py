    Highwind AI Solution - Document Verifier

    The Highwind AI Document Verifier provides an easy way to analyse financial related documents (financial statements, purchase orders, etc) as an API service for clients.   ## Flow `get_upload_url` **-->** `PUT` presigned URL **-->** Highwind AI Solution analyses `pdf` file **-->** `get_results`  ## Endpoints ### 1. Upload Document: get_upload_url/{object}?document-type={type} - This endpoint generates two items:   - A presigned URL required to upload the file to our storage system.   - A unique `task_id` which is associated with the presigned URL - You need to use this presigned URL to upload the `pdf` file (currently, only `pdf` files are accepted) for analysis with a `PUT` request    - Content type is `application/pdf`   - Files should be ideally kept under 5mb in size. - `{object}` is a string field which will be the name of the file that is uploaded to the storage system. - `{type}` is the string query parameter that determines the type of document that will be analysed. For example:   - `?document-type=afs` for annual financial statements    - `?document-type=bs` for bank statements    ### 2. Post document to presigned URL using PUT - To use the presigned URL from step 1: Send a PUT request with the curl command. Include the full path to your file and the presigned URL itself. - Command: ```curl -X PUT -T \"/path/to/file\" \"presigned URL\"```    ### 3. Get Results: get_results/{object} - This endpoint returns the summary of the `pdf` file that was uploaded via the presigned URL.   - It takes about 1 - 2 minutes to generate the summary. For larger files it will take more time. It will return `in_progress` while it analysing the `pdf` file. - `{object}` is a string field for you to add the generated `task_id` to look up the associated summary.    `OPTIONS` endpoints are for CORS purposes only.    ### Links
